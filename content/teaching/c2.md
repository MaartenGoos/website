## Introduction

## Firm wage premia

If labor markets would be perfectly competitive, firm wage premia would not exist for equally productive workers. Here we discuss that firm wage premia do exist and are important in explaining wage inequality. 

#### Card, Heining and Kline (2013)

The paper discussed is Card, Heining and Kline (2013), “Workplace Heterogeneity and the Rise of West German Wage Inequality”, <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>. The discussion explains the AKM estimator to identify worker and firm types and it shows the importance of firm wage premia and sorting in explaining wage inequality. The discussion also refers to other papers for further reading.
