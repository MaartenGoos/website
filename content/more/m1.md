## Summary

In this podcast, Vishwa, Milda and I discuss the Future of Work, job polarization and AI, AI regulation options, the thinning middle class, increased inequality, the value of education, how do we deal with a green transition, what’s with this “labour shortage” we’ve been hearing about, whether increasing wages mean higher inflation, and how can we improve the way we teach economics.
