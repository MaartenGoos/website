##### Abstract

There has been a large rise in the number of well paid jobs in the UK over the past 25 years, but also a rise in the number of badly paid jobs. The most likely cuase of these trends is technology replacing middling jobs, with structural changes in the labour force playing a less important role. Policies to increase pay among the low paid, and immigration seem likely to be most effective at dealing with the problems caused by the increasing polarization of work.
