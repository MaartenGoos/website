##### Abstract

Using a large-scale survey of innovation within Dutch enterprises, linked with register data, this study examines how technology implementation within workplaces impacts job ending among workers. We examine how the impact of technology differs depending on a worker' education, organizational tenure and age. We find that, for the technologies captured in our survey data, innovation is associated with an overall decrease in a worker's probability to leave the firm. We also find that higher educational attainment is associated with a lower probability of job ending. Furthermore, we find that older workers and workers with longer organizational tenure have a higher probability of job ending when their firm innovates. Finally, we do not find the probability of job ending to change differently depending on the union density of the industry in which the firm operates. In conclusion, our results do not support a simple view about the impact of technology adoption on individual workers' job ending probabilities.
