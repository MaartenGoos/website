##### Abstract

The digitaltransformation is rapidly changingthe demand for workers’ skills, and this poses several challenges. One such challenge is how do we define ‘skills’ in the digital economy. Another challenge is who invest in workers’ digital skills? This chapter discusses 1) policies to better measure digital skills, personal learning accounts; 2) policies focussed on training of workers; and 3) the role of intermediaries to help reduce the skills gap.
