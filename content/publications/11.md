##### Abstract

Using a large-scale survey of innovation within Dutch enterprises, linked with register data, we create a longitudinal  employer–employee dataset to study the effect of technology implementation on enterprise workforces. While the proportion of middle educated workers leaving enterprises increases, we also find an increase in the fraction of middle educated entrants. Our main finding regarding changes in the firm's age structure is that there is an increase in the proportion of older workers. Finally, our results regarding institutional variation do not lend a simple interpretation of different effects in more unionized enterprises. In conclusion, our results do not support a simple view about the impact of technology adoption on enterprise workforces.
