##### Abstract

This paper discusses recent evidence about the impact of AI on workers and workplaces, and the implications of AI for data goverance. For firms and their workers, it is important to understand how AI changes the very notion of creativity and the organization of work, while generating new power asymmetries and modifying working conditions, workersâ€™ representation and the protection of acquired rights. A challenge for data governance is to reconcile the objectives of creating private incentives to maximise data sharing for purposes of public interest, while limiting the concentration of private value arising from (involuntary or voluntary) data collection and analytics. These insights should be embedded in the context of a global AI
regulation and digital governance.
