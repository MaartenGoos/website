##### Abstract

We examine the impact of job search assistance for the unemployed on their search effort on an Online Job Platform (OJP). We find that individuals who search more intensively without assistance are also more likely to take-up assistance when offered. Using a staggered DiD design that allows for selective take-up, we find that those more likely to take-up assistance are also more responsive to it. This implies that barriers to job search assistance effectively screen out those that need it most. We also find that the impact of assistance is on search effort is short-lived, and that there is strong negative duration dependence in job search effort.
