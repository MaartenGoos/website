## Introduction

This course focusses on labor market inequality. It starts by discussing rising dispersion in firm wage premia and worker sorting, and declining labor shares. The course then dives into possible drivers of these changes by discussing recent theoretical and empirical insights into the labor market impacts of technological progress, globalization, unions, and firms' monopsony power.

## 1. Firm wage premia and worker sorting

If firms have no wage-setting power, firm wage premia would not exist for equally productive workers. Here we discuss that firm wage premia do exist and are important for explaining wage inequality. 

#### Card, Heining and Kline (2013) *

The paper discussed is Card, Heining and Kline (2013), “Workplace Heterogeneity and the Rise of West German Wage Inequality”, <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>. The discussion explains the AKM estimator to identify worker and firm types in matched employer-employee data and shows the importance of firm wage premia and sorting in explaining wage inequality. The discussion also refers to other papers for further reading.

## 2. The declining labor share

After decades of stability, the labor share has recently declined. Here we discuss the various reasons why this is the case.

#### Grossman and Oberfield (2022) *

The paper discussed is Grossman and Oberfield (2022), “The Elusive Explanation for the Declining Labor Share”, <i>Annual Review of Economics</i>. The discussion gives an overview of recent papers with different explanations for the declining labor share.

## 3. Technological change

In the last decade, there has been a paradigm shift in our thinking about the labor market impact of technological change. Up to 2010, the canonical model of the skill premium was most popular due to its simplicity and explanatory power. Today, task models of automation and the creation of new labor tasks are the dominant framework. This section consists of several subsections:
+ The canonical model
+ Task models with capital and labor
+ Library of relevant papers    

### 3.1 The canonical model

The canonical model was the standard throughout the 1990s and 2000s to explain the rise in returns to skill and wage inequality. 

#### Acemoglu and Autor (2011) - Part 1 *

This section discusses the first part in Acemoglu and Autor (2011), "Skills, Tasks and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings", <i>Handbook of Labor Economics</i>, Sections 1-3, p. 1044-1117. The discussion summarizes the success of the canonical model in explaining the skill premium, but also its challenges that have lead to the emergence of task models.

#### Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003)

The paper discussed is Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003), "The Skill Content of Recent Technological Change: An Empirical Exploration", <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>. The discussion explains how occupations intensive in routine labor tasks have been automated by computer machinery. Embedding their task model into the canonical framework, the authors also show that these underlying changes in task demand can explain a substantial part of the increase in the skill premium.

### 3.2 Task models with capital and labor

Today's task models focus on the productive efficiency of labor and capital, with automation increasing the comparative advantage for capital in doing certain tasks. The creation of new labor new labor tasks focusses on the automation of capital tasks by workers due to technological progress. Task models are not only informative about increases in overall wage inequality, but also provide an intuitive explanation for the recent decline in the labor share due to automation.

#### Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019a) *

The paper discussed is Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019a), "Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor", <i>Journal of Economic Perspectives</i>. The discussion provides an introduction to task models assuming tasks are combined CES to produce aggregate output. The model presented predicts that automation decreases the labor share if the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in aggregate output is not larger than unity. The discussion then tests this prediction using sectoral data and a decomposition of the aggregate labor share.

#### Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019b)

The paper discussed is Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019b), "Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Work", <i>NBER Conference Volume The Economics of Artificial Intelligence</i>, Chapter 8. The discussion presents the simplest possible task model of automation and creation of labor tasks assuming tasks are combined Cobb-Douglas to produce aggregate output. The discussion then focusses on the importance of labor market institutions such as wage rents in the context of automation.
